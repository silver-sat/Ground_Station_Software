# Ground Control Software

The ground control software presents a user interface for entering commands to the satellite and receiving responses. It also enables the use of gpredict radio Doppler data for the ground radio.

The ground control software is a web application designed to run on a Flask development server in a single-threaded environment on a single laptop. It is not secured for network deployment and the serial link to the ground radio is not implemented for use in a multi-threaded environment.

## Installing the User Interface

Clone the Avionics_Software repository from github to a local directory on the laptop. If the repository is already present, ensure it is up to date using git pull or the equivalent.

Open a command shell and navigate to the ground_software directory in the FlatSat directory. Create a python virtual environment with the following command

```python3 -m venv .venv```

Activate the virtual environment with 

```. .venv/bin/activate```

Note that the .venv directory is a hidden file (it starts with "."), so you may have to use command line options or change the settings of your file manager to see it in a file listing.

Now install Flask using this command

```pip install Flask```

Python virtual environments are recommended for use with Flask, and may be required by your operating system. If you understand the implications, you may be able to install Flask at the system level using a package manager or other method.

Install pyserial using this command

```pip install pyserial```

Now move to the control directory in the ground_software directory and enter the following command

```Flask run --debug```

This starts the app.py application in the folder. If you receive an error message, you may need to modify the serial port name in app.py to match the port name on your system.

Open a browser and navigate to the address displayed, typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/

You may now enter commands to the satellite by clicking a button or typing a command on the command line.

## Installing the Radio Doppler Control

Install the gpredict application on the laptop following the instructions for the operating system.

The gpredict_radio_interface.py program in the radio folder and the Flask web application provide the functions of Hamlib rigctld daemon. You do not need rigctld to control the radio frequency.

Open a new command window, navigate to the radio folder, and enter the command

```gpredict_radio_interface.py```

The program will listen on the default TCP/IP port used by gpredict for radio frequency information.

Now launch gpredict, add a radio as explained in the User Manual, open the radio interface, select a satellite in Target and track it. Verify that the Flask application is running. Select your radio in Settings and engage it. Radio Doppler data for the selected satellite will be transmitted to the ground radio.
